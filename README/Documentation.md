# Installation

Installation using pip:

$ `pip install spankbang_api`

Or Install directly from GitHub

`pip install git+https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/spankbang_api`

# Important Notice

# Usage

Import Spankbang API like in the example below:

```python
from spankbang_api.spankbang_api import Client, Quality, Video
from base_api.modules.download import threaded, default, FFMPEG
```

# Client
### Initialize a Client

```python
from spankbang_api.spankbang_api import Client
client = Client()
```

### Get a video object

```python
from spankbang_api.spankbang_api import Client
video = Client().get_video(url="<video_url>")
```

### Cached Objects

Most objects are cached. Meaning that every time you access the API without changing the video, the attributes
aren't reloaded. Instead, they are cached. This makes it very efficient. 

## Video Attributes

| Attribute             | Returns  | is cached? |
|:----------------------|:--------:|:----------:|
| .title                |   str    |    Yes     |
| .author               |   str    |    Yes     |
| .length               |   str    |    Yes     |
| .publish_date         |   str    |    Yes     |
| .tags                 |   list   |    Yes     |
| .video_qualities      |   list   |    Yes     |
| .direct_download_urls |   list   |    Yes     |
| .thumbnail            |   str    |    Yes     |
| .description          |   str    |    Yes     |
| .embed_url            |   str    |    Yes     | 
| .rating               | str (%)  |    Yes     |

## Download a video


```python
from spankbang_api.spankbang_api import Client, Quality
client = Client()
video = client.get_video("<video_url>")
quality = Quality.BEST # Best quality as an example

video.download(quality=quality, path="your_path_here")
# Custom Callback

# You can define your own callback instead if tqdm. You must make a function that takes pos and total as arguments.
# This will disable tqdm
def custom_callback(downloaded, total):
    """This is an example of how you can implement the custom callback"""

    percentage = (downloaded / total) * 100
    print(f"Downloaded: {downloaded} bytes / {total} bytes ({percentage:.2f}%)")
```

Arguments:

- quality: Can be a Quality object or a string: ("best", "half", "worst")
- downloader: Can be a downloader object or a string: ("threaded", "FFMPEG", "default")

The Downloader defines which method will be used to fetch the segments. FFMPEG is the most stable one, but not as fast
as the threaded one and it needs FFMPEG installed on your system. The "default" will fetch one segment by one, which is
very slow, but stable. Threaded downloads can get as high as 70 MB per second.

- no_title: `True` or `False` if the video title shouldn't be assigned automatically. If you set this to `True`, you need
to include the title by yourself into the output path and additionally the file extension.

- use_hls: `True` or `False` whether to use segment downloading or raw file downloading. Raw file downloading is the easiest one,
but if you use this you circumvent spankbang's login system, so might not be the best -_-, but hey I don't care ;) 

  
## Quality

The quality class is used for video downloading. It has three attributes:

- Quality.BEST (representing the best quality)
- Quality.HALF (representing something in the middle)
- Quality.WORST (representing the worst quality)

! This can also be a string instead of the object like:

- Quality.BEST == `best`
- Quality.HALF == `half`
- Quality.WORST == `worst`
